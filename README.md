## Configuring the app
Configuration is exclusively done by setting environment variables:
* `PORT` : The port to bind HTTP to. Default port is `8080`
* `GH_TOKEN` : The token to authenticated to github. By default, no token is used, so API calls are not authenticated.
* `EVENT_DATE` : The date to restrict contribution search to. It must follows the github search date format (more details [here](https://help.github.com/articles/understanding-the-search-syntax/#query-for-dates)). Default value is `>=2005` which basically fetch everything without any restriction.
* `PARTICIPANTS_FILE` : The URI or file path to the file containing the participants' github usernames.
* **[Deprecated]** `OBJECTIVE` : Number of pull requests to make in order to complete the challenge. Default value is `4`.


## Building & Running the app

Make sure you have [go](http://go.dev) installed and then build the application by running
```bash
    go build .
```

Then run the following command
```bash
    ./leaderboard
    # or
    ./leaderboard.exe
```
then run it locally in http://localhost:8080
